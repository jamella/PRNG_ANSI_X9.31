# PRNG_ANSI_X9.31
Random Number Generator  Based on ANSI X9.31


ANSI X9.31 Appendix A.2.4 Using AES
Let ede*X(Y) represent the AES encryption of Y under the key *X.

For AES 128-bit key, let *K be a 128 bit key.
For AES 192-bit key, let *K be a 192 bit key.
For AES 256-bit key, let *K be a 256 bit key.

This *K is reserved only for the generation of pseudo random numbers.
Let V be a 128-bit seed value which is also kept secret, and XOR be the exclusive-or
operator. Let DT be a date/time vector which is updated on each iteration. I is a
intermediate value. A vector R is generated as follows (Note for AES implementations
DT, I, and R are 128-bits each.):

  I = ede *K(DT)
  
  R = ede *K(I XOR V) and a new V is generated by V = ede*K(R Xor I).
